# Project-On-Delhi-Air-Pollution

## Business Objectives:-- 

        Particulate matter (PM ) has been recorded in Delhi to understand the air quality
        on an hourly basis for 4 months. Our objective is to forecast the data available .

## Data Set Details:--

        PM2. 5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than
        2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair and usually seen
        through a microscope.
        
        There are 2374 records of  pm25 and date. Date variable contains dates with hourly records of pm2.5.

## Acceptance Criteria:--
        Should get the least possible RMSE and the model should be deployed
        using Flask/ RShiny/Heroku.
